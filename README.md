MailVerify

A next-generation trust layer for email. Verify once. Deliver everywhere.

MailVerify is building a lightweight, cryptographically secure system to prove sender identity inside email systemsâ€”without needing plugins, inbox scraping, or invasive software. Think of it like a blue checkmark for your email address, backed by real-world verification.

Why MailVerify?

Email is broken. Anyone can impersonate anyone. Deliverability is fuzzy. Trust is invisible.

MailVerify fixes that by:

Verifying who you are using trusted methods (institutional, domain-based, or social validation)

Signing your messages with a tamper-proof trust token

Displaying an email badge in inboxes or headers

Boosting deliverability and recipient confidence
