# 📬 MailVerify

> A next-generation trust layer for email.  
> **Verify once. Deliver everywhere.**

MailVerify is building a lightweight, cryptographically secure system to prove sender identity inside email systems—without plugins, inbox scraping, or invasive software.  
Think of it like a blue checkmark for your email address, backed by real-world verification.

## ❌ Why MailVerify?

Email is broken.  
- Anyone can impersonate anyone  
- Deliverability is unpredictable  
- Trust is invisible

## ✅ What MailVerify Does

- **Verifies who you are** using trusted methods (institutional, domain-based, or social validation)  
- **Signs your messages** with a tamper-proof trust token  
- **Adds a verifiable header** or trust badge to your emails  
- **Boosts deliverability** and recipient confidence without requiring inbox access
